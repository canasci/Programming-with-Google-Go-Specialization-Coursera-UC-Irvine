Moore's Law predicted that transistor density in CPUs would double every two years. This law is an observation, not a physical law. 
There are several reasons behind why this law is deprecated nowadays:

1. Transistors consume power when they switch. Smaller transistors switch faster. Exponential increase in density would lead to exponential increase in speed.
2. Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption. Altough smaller transistors
use less power than larger ones, density scaling is the main factor. High power will lead to high temperature. 
3. The dynamic power of a transistor is directly proportional with the square of the voltage value through it. According to Dennard Scaling Theory, voltage should scale with
transistor size but due to the activation potential(saturation region) of a transistor for it to be able to switch between high and low states, the voltage must be above a certain threshold
value.
4. Power leakage due to insulating material that separates transistors with their surrounding medium. As transistors shrink in size, maintaining leakage gets limited.
5. Heat dissipation limits in available cooling systems cannot compensate this heat generation.
